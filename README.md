# C-Concepts
ðŸ“Œ What is C++?

C++ is a statically typed, high-performance programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.

ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts in C++

1. Built-in Elements
   
Keywords: Predefined words with special meaning (e.g., int, return, class)

Functions: Predefined or standard functions (e.g., main(), printf(), cin)

Modules / Libraries: Collections of built-in functionalities (e.g., <iostream>, <cmath>)

2. User-Defined Elements
   
Custom elements like variables, structures, classes, and functions created by the programmer.

ðŸ§® Variables

A variable is a name that refers to a memory location used to store a value.
ðŸ‘‰ The value of a variable can be modified during program execution.

ðŸ“¦ Data Types in C++

1. Built-in Data Types:
   
int â€“ Integer values

float â€“ Floating-point numbers

char â€“ Characters

string â€“ Text (via <string> library)

array â€“ Collection of fixed-size elements

2. User-Defined Data Types:
   
struct â€“ Structure

union â€“ Union
