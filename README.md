# Basic concept of C++
📌 What is C++?

C++ is a statically typed, high-performance programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.

🔹 Core Concepts in C++

1. Built-in Elements
   
Keywords: Predefined words with special meaning (e.g., int, return, class)

Functions: Predefined or standard functions (e.g., main(), printf(), cin)

Modules / Libraries: Collections of built-in functionalities (e.g., <iostream>, <cmath>)

2. User-Defined Elements
   
Custom elements like variables, structures, classes, and functions created by the programmer.

🧮 Variables

A variable is a name that refers to a memory location used to store a value.
👉 The value of a variable can be modified during program execution.

📦 Data Types in C++

1. Built-in Data Types:
   
int – Integer values

float – Floating-point numbers

char – Characters

string – Text (via <string> library)

array – Collection of fixed-size elements

2. User-Defined Data Types:
   
struct – Structure

union – Union

class – Class

🏷️ What is a Class?

A class is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for objects.
It groups data members and functions that operate on those data.

🕒 Compile-Time vs Run-Time

Phase	Description

Compile Time

The stage where the source code is translated into object code (machine-level code). Errors like syntax and type checking are caught here.

Run Time

The phase when the compiled program is executed. Memory allocation, user input, and dynamic operations happen here.
